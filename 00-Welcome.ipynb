    "## This is NOT a Demo or Coding Workshop\n",
    "Instead, the purpose of this workshop is to teach you to think a bit like a software engineer (like me!). Meaning, how to design your software to optimize reproducability, readability, maintainability and code-reuse. Yes, we'll use some Python and some cool tools along the way, but that's just means to an end. The real takeaway -- I hope -- is that you will learn new strategies for designing your code that will make you more efficient and much less frustrated as your research goals (and code) change over time."
